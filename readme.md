This assignment is about Test Driven Development with Java.

Test Driven Development develops tests for every small functionality of an application
which makes us as developers consider use of a method before the implementation
of it.

This assignment uses Maven as a project management tool and
JUnit 5 as the test framework.

The goal is to create a Colour class with 2 constructors, 
1 with 3 floating values to represent RGB values in range 0.0 and 1.0.
Another constructor with one integer representing a combined
RGB value.
This class also has an equals method which checks if two colour objects are equal.
